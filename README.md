# Ensemble Flutter Demo

This repository demonstrates seamless integration between Ensemble UI and Flutter, enabling developers to combine the power of Ensemble's low-code approach with Flutter's rich widget ecosystem. The project showcases how to embed Ensemble screens within a Flutter application and how Flutter custom widgets can be used directly within Ensemble screens.

## Integration Flows

### Opening Ensemble Screens from Flutter

The demo shows how native Flutter applications can easily navigate to and render Ensemble-based screens. This flow demonstrates:

1. Initializing the Ensemble framework within a Flutter application
2. Navigating from Flutter UI to Ensemble screens
3. Passing data between Flutter and Ensemble contexts

### Using Custom Flutter Widgets in Ensemble

The project also demonstrates how to create and use custom Flutter widgets within Ensemble screens:

1. Defining custom Flutter widgets with configurable properties
2. Registering widgets with the Ensemble framework
3. Using Flutter widgets declaratively in Ensemble YAML
4. Passing and propagating values between Ensemble and custom Flutter widgets
